LIFE REVIEW # 2
<br>
<br>
Life is okay currently
<br>
I moved to New York 9 months ago I guess.,
<br>
Last september…
<br>
   I’m beginning to no longer be able to
<br>
Say that I just moved here
<br>
 I would say that
<br>
   It has been a lot worse
<br>
And harder 
<br>
  Than i expected
<br>
<br>

There have been some good 
<br>
  Time, but so many bad ones.
<br>
I think it has been the hardest year of 
<br>
My life so far.
<br>
<br>
  
  I guess I feel free?
<br>
  I use to want this so bad
<br>
But now it just kinda sucks
<br>
<br>

I’m pretty lonely sometimes
<br>
When my 5 friends are busy,
<br>
And I don’t feel like making music 
<br>
Or ,
<br>
Art
<br>
Or, I don’t have work
<br>
<br>

My friends were busy tonight
<br>
I felt pretty bad
<br>
<br>

I called my friend who doesn’t
<br>
Live here 
<br>
And he gave me really good advice 
<br>
And said that I have to trust that the world 
<br>
Is putting me where I need to be right 
<br>
Now
<br>
<br>

The world is choosing a difficult 9 months for me
<br>
Currently
<br>
<br>

But I guess this is like doing push ups
<br>
So i can get my six pack
<br>
<br>

I gave up on my six pack in real life
<br>
I was going to Planet Fitness for a while
<br>
<br>

But I quit,
<br>
I hated it there
<br>
It smelled weird
<br>
<br>

And the lights were too white
<br>
And too bright
<br>
And i found working out so boring
<br>
<br>

I would rather do a lot of things
<br>
<br>

What would i not rather do???
<br>
<br>

I would not rather be at the airport
<br>
<br>
Or at the dentist,
<br>
<br>
<br>

Current life review 
<br>
6/10
<br>
<br>

The end.

KETAMINE REVIEW:
<br>
<br>
I feel very strange and a bit dizzy.
<br>
I feel relaxed, I feel slightly scared.
<br>
<br>
I am sitting. I’m not sure how walking would feel.
<br>
<br>
There is music playing. 
<br>
(was at a electronic noise show at a chinese restaurant)
<br>
It’s cool, it’s ambient though it sounds evil to me.
<br>
<br>
It sounds scary. 
<br>
I do not find it beautiful, I find it ominous.
<br>
<br>
This is one of the most bizarre days of recent times.
<br>
<br>
What if this is a k-hole
<br>
What is a k-hole?
<br>
<br>
I looked at the wall and 
<br>
I thought it was a TV playing
<br>
A hockey game.
<br>
<br>
I haven’t decided if this is 
<br>
A pleasant experience or not yet.
<br>
<br>
I’m doing all the New York classics today,
<br>
I ate a bagel this morning,
<br>
I had therapy and then a 
<br>
Beautiful woman came to 
<br>
My house and we had sex.
<br>
<br>
We showered and she left.
<br>
<br>
I plan to see her tomorrow.
<br>
<br>
I am Scotty and I am doing
<br>
Everything I can to be good
<br>
And feel proud.
<br>
I am very human,
<br>
I don’t think I know spirituality
<br>
I think I love the game.
<br>
<br>
I think I am a player
<br>
Of the game of life.
<br>
<br>
Life is strong, though I
<br>
Shall prevail?
<br>
But why must I (unintelligible)
<br>
Am I at odds with it?
<br>
We must live in Harmony.
<br>
I should be friends with life.
<br>
I shouldn’t see it as a 
<br>
War.
<br>
<br>
We must coexist.
<br>
<br>
I am a 23 year old 
<br>
Boy in New Yok City in the
<br>
Basement of a chinese
<br>
Restaurant listening to ambient
<br>
Noise music,
<br>
On drugs,
<br>
Having big thoughts.
<br>
Am I stupid?
<br>
<br>
I may be.
<br>
<br>
She use to say she 
<br>
Could see a deep wisdom inside
<br>
Of me and I loved that.
<br>
And I wonder if it’s true.
<br>
<br> 
And I know there’s things inside
<br>
Of me that I have to unlock
<br>
<br>
2 random people just sat 
<br>
Down across the booth with me
<br>
And alice and it’s
<br>
Strange.
<br>
<br>
I don’t want this to end,
<br>
I wish everybody here didn’t 
<br>
Really exist.
<br>
<br>
I wish I could walk through 
<br>
Them all and the walls and 
<br>
The chairs and roll around on
<br>
The floor and have
<br>
Profound thoughts.

Blake: Oh he just stayed there for a couple minutes enjoying it… I just pooped and then 
I went to the bathroom

	<br>
<br>
Scotty: Do you know any taekwondo? Or like self-defense in

Scotty: I bet
<br>
	<br>
Blake: And I wish .. yeah… so like, thank you for bringing that up, thank you for reminding me,
 because, *sigh* I really want to…
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: You should, I mean, for one, it’s good physical exercise, and it’s just good to know,
 you could learn a lot of good moves. Taekwondo is cool.
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Taekwondo. I really wanna do it because like,
	<br>
	Okay I know I’m an actor, I know I’m a stripper, but like “Nicolas”, my real name, the ‘other
   guy’, he’s like the vegan prep chef, the reiki master, he’s like all of that, I’ve just been
    focusing on “Blake”, but no I’m really all about… yeah… yeah
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: What does it feel like to be “Blake” vs “Nicolas”
<br>
	<br>
Blake: They’re really completely guys… Can I tell you a secret?
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Yeah
	<br>
<br>
Blake: Well it’s not a secret, but can I tell you how “Blake” became?  Okay, I was meditating, 
like years ago cuz I was really serious, I’m like okay, if I’m gonna do it I’m gonna do it. So 
I meditated on “Blake” and I asked myself, like, which one of my favorite artists all have sex 
and have a baby?? And that would be me?? So it turned out to be Megan the Stallion, Ke$ha, Bad 
Bunny, Bella Hadid Cunt..
	<br>
<br>
Scotty: So because they all had babies you thought you needed to have a baby too?
<br>
	<br>
Blake: No, they ALL had sex and they just had one baby.. Yeah.. thats, “Blake” ahahaha , and a 
sprinkle of Lana Del Ray
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: So that’s what “Blake” is? It’s a combination of all those celebrities?
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Huh?
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: You’re saying “Blake” is a combination of all those celebrities who are you idols?
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Yes, yeah
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: So how does that relate to having a baby?
<br>
	<br>
Blake: TttThat’s the crazy part, it’s like, I just picture them all having sex..
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: OH so you’re the baby?
<br>
	<br>
Blake: ..having sex and just making ONE baby, I’m that baby..
	<br>
	Yeah…
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: That’s really cool
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Also I’m the cast of Schitt's Creek, hahah
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: I’ve never seen that, but I’ve heard of it
<br>
	<br>
Blake: They are also a part of.. My art.
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: What kind of art do you do besides acting? Or is it just your way of life?
<br>
	<br>
Blake: I trust you.. I like you.. I’m gonna tell you, I’m gonna start this company that’s c
alled *REDACTED* where it’s like a mixture of *REDACTED* and *REDACTED* and *REDACTED* and 
just reminding people to *REDACTED*, and that’s *REDACTED*
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: That’s cool, are you excited to start a company?
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Yeah
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: I would too if I was you. That’s pretty unimaginable to me, to start a company
<br>
	<br>
Blake: What are your thoughts on it? Be honest
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: I don’t fully understand what it is, like I don’t even know what *REDACTED* is 
or *REDACTED* or *REDACTED*
	<br>
	Like what makes this a crazy idea?
	<br>
	Tell me why this is, *Scotty makes actions with his hands that implies an idea so great 
  that it makes your brain explode*... That
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Because baby, when I’m teaching my student, and teaching my people who come to my 
classes, were just learning how to like … because… the normal thing when you’re doing
 *REDACTED* or whatever or with a *REDACTED* practitioner, it’s just that they just 
 grab energy from the universe and just spread it on you,
	<br>
	I’m just like different, I wanna like see people laughing., dancing, being silly, 
  connecting with your inner child, um going all out, and just being sexy as well, umm yeah.
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: So you’re silly and sexy
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Yeah HAhahahaHa
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Are those your two favorite things to be? I think that is you.. You're silly 
and sexy. It’s like your two top things
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Really?
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Maybe.. You’re silly, sexy, and smiley, 
<br>
	<br>
Blake: And nasty
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: you’re crazy
<br>
	<br>
Blake: HAhaHAHA, wait till you see me work
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Maybe I’ll come one day for fun
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Yeah being your girlfriends
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: I don’t have that many girlfriends
<br>
	<br>
Blake: It’s so funny, so I work last night.. Wait , what’s today? Today’s thursday.
 So I worked last night, bitch, I was number one, it was a slow night, I was number one, like 
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Do you have sex with your co-workers?
<br>
	<br>
Blake: No, cause they’re all pretty much straight.
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: I work with mostly gay guys actually
<br>
	<br>
Blake: In your corporate job??
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: No I work at a restaurant
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Where?
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: In Williamsburg
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Oh yeah… That makes sense now. Do they hit on you?
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: They are fun. Uh there is one guy who says he’s in love with me and I call him papi. I like it
<br>
	<br>
Blake: You’re cute
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Thanks
<br>
	<br>
Blake: I would sit on your face.. For some money..HAAHhaha
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: You’d have to pay me for that
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Oh No no no no no, oh yeah, this is why I wanted to say… speaking of that, yesterday, yeah, 
I was number one and there was a point where like, I brought two customers back with me, one of
 them was a midget and the other one was just like watching, but they all fuckin paid me
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Did you suck their dick or something?
<br>
	<br>
Blake: I shouldn’t but I did 
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Hahaha
<br>
	<br>
Blake: I did… I have to be careful, but I was careful, I was like keep it down.
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: What are the chances that the midget is a secret cop? There can’t be many undercover midget cops
<br>
	<br>
Blake: The real reason is because that place I work, on Wednesdays, we work at 2 different places, 
one near *REDACTED* and the other near *REDACTED*, but no, it’s like, I’m just always careful with
 my bosses because there is also a thing like, a shower scene, like there’s a shower, and I talked 
 to the owner of that bar uhhh I guess I’m doing it next Wednesday… uhh yeah when it comes to my 
 bosses I’m really so respectful
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Wait so there’s a shower scene and that’s like a special event and you got chosen for it? 
<br>
	Congratulations 
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Yeah I told my boss, I’m like, I wanna do it. And he’s like, okay, look at this guy and 
how he does it. And I told my boss I can do it way sexier. And he was like okay, and yeah *snap*...
<br>
	Are you gonna get me a beer?
	<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Get you a beer? I’ll contribute 3 dollars towards a beer
<br>
	<br>
Blake: No, get me a beer. 
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Why? I’m not gonna have sex with you
<br>
	<br>
Blake: No I’m just really having fun making a new friend
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: You just told me you made so much money
<br>
	<br>
Blake: I know I spent it all
<br>
	<br>
Scotty: Go get yourself a beer. Here’s some money, you can get a budweiser.
<br>
	<br>
Blake: Thanks babe I’ll be right back, watch this okay?

	<br>
	LIFE REVIEW #!
	<br>
	<br>

    …I am 23 right now. I don’t know if I’m where I imagined I’d be at 23. Though I guess 
	<br>
    I never even plotted out where I would be before. Maybe if I would’ve I could’ve ended 
	<br>
    up there and I woulda been really successful or feel like I am doing really good at life. 
	<br>
	<br>
        Currently I’m doing okay at life. I think when I was 18 or 19 I felt so much momentum
	<br>
        in my life. It felt like everything was just getting better and I was improving at all
	<br>
         my skills and doing good at making people pay attention to the music I made. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I felt 
	<br>
         like I was on a path to maybe be a successful artist. Successful in the sense that I
	<br>
          imagined I would get signed to a record label and tour and everyone would recognize
	<br>
           my talents and it would be awesome and I would be best friends with all the artists 
	<br>
           I ever looked up to.
	<br>
        That didn’t happen,,
	<br>
    Yet…
	<br>
	<br>
           I don’t know what will happen or what I even want to happen as I get older. I guess
	<br>
            I want to keep getting better at stuff. I do think I’ve gotten a lot better at
	<br>
             most the stuff I do. I’ve gotten worse at some things too. But mostly better at stuff. 
	<br>
        In some ways I’m a lot more confident than I used to be and in some ways I’m not.
	<br>
	<br>
        I think when I was 18 I was blindly confident. It was a small time in my life where 
	<br>
        I didn’t seem to worry about being cringe. I think it probably resulted in some cringe
	<br>
         art or actions, but also it was probably the most creatively liberated time of my life so far.
	<br>
        I guess I’m just hoping things will get better when I get older this time. I think in
	<br>
         the past couple years I hit the happiness peak of life so far and I’ve definitely felt
	<br>
          the downhill slope after finishing college and moving to New York. 
	<br>
	<br>
        When I was 18 and moved to Boston from Houston for school it was maybe the best year of my
	<br>
         life. Either maybe that year or the one right after. I felt the most free and happy I
	<br>
         ever have. At least since I was like 5 maybe. 
	<br>
	<br>
        When I was 5 I remember feeling generally happy and when I started to turn 7 I started to
	<br>
        become more aware of the world and the world was harder than it was before and I felt 
	<br>
        sad more, or ashamed more, or embarrassed more; just more negative feelings generally.
	<br>
        I wonder where I’ll be in 5 years. I’ll probably get more mature. I think I’m still immature.
	<br>
         Somewhat, I’m working on it, but I hope I stay playful.
	<br>
        I hope I’m proud of the things I make and it would be cool if I was successful so 
	<br>
        I don’t still work at the restaurant.
	<br>
        Working at the restaurant is okay.
	<br>
	<br>
        I like my co-workers, they are funny and I prank them and we tickle each other and
	<br>
        they speak spanish and I try to listen and learn.
	<br>
	<br>
        But also it kinda sucks working there. It’s generally pretty boring. I have so much 
	<br>
        more fun being at home working on whatever I want like music or collaging or
	<br>
        making this website or anything. 
	<br>
	<br>
        It’s a lot more fun being at home than being at work.
	<br>
        I think everyone feels that way.
	<br>
        I just hope I can find a way to break the system so I can do whatever I want and be Lazy and HAVE FUN.
