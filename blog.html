Conversation with a stripper / man of the night

Scotty: I wanna do one without smiling
	
Scotty: That was good, I’ll send it to her. 
		You actually look really sexy in this photo,
		Look at your jawline

Blake: Ew I don’t even like it but that’s fine

Scotty: I don’t love it either, for me…

Blake: hahaha

Scotty: For me.. I’m going with the smiling one
      Uh… I was thinking about something, I forgot what it was..

Blake: Do you like ketamine?

Scotty: I did ketamine once and I liked it

Blake: You liked it? Was it like outside? Or..

Scotty: I was actually on the roof of my house. I was with one of my really good friends
 and a guy I just met and we just hung out for a couple hours and talked and it was really fun.
You like ketamine?

Blake: Can I be honest?
..Bitch I would fucking drop
   Everything:   Alcohol, cocaine, everything for ketamine

Scotty: Really?

Blake: Like if I were to choose to just do ketamine… 
           I really just wanna be at that point in my life where I can luxuriously choose 
           ketamine, y’know uhh at certain beautiful times and I would just be the happiest boy
It’s my favorite drug in the world
Scotty: It was fun when I did it, I liked it

Blake: You should fuck on it

Scotty: That would be cool.. I haven’t had sex on any drugs
I guess I’ve smoked weed and had sex

Blake: When was the last time you had sex? Last week?

Scotty: Like… Sunday.. It’s Thursday

Blake: So like 5 days.. That’s hot

Scotty: This girl is freaky.. I think I was gonna say this,
	      This girl laughs when I have sex with her and that’s really interesting to me

Blake: Oh so you had sex with her??

Scotty: I had sex with her yeah, like twice

Blake: So why are you acting like,, Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah
	like , “what happens if I like..”

Scotty: I don’t know

Blake: You fucking little pussy ass bitch? What the fuck? 
		You fucked.

Scotty: I know, I am a pussy. I’m still just figuring out this whole new world, y’know? 

Blake: Yeah, can I tell you a piece of advice? 

Scotty: Yeah please

Blake: Baby, just do it. Just do it 

Scotty: I like that

Blake: Um, it’s so funny, like I told you earlier, I’m like 4 chapters deep, this actor book 
is telling me it’s all about repetition and and and just kinda like, just do it, just, … oh
Repetition and the second was like just-deficationsfdnj (justification)

Scotty: Did you say just defecation? Just poop?

Blake: Hah, hah, hahahaha, EW

Scotty: Poop is gross

Blake: Unless, y’know.. It’s 2025 everything is on the menu

Scotty: Not for me personally

Blake: But you know what I was saying earlier, right?

Scotty: What?

Blake: Just do it baby, just do it

Scotty: Have you pooped on someone before?

Blake: Have I pooped on someone?

Scotty: Yeah

Blake: Yeah for a lot of money

Scotty: Oh my gosh how much money

Blake: It was 1000$

Scotty: That’s worth it. I would do that for sure.
		In their mouth or just on them?

Blake: On them

Scotty: What did you do with it after?

Blake: They were laying on the floor right…
		I pooped from his face…
   		I made sure I ate a lot ..
 		I pooped from his face all the way to his cock

Scotty: Oh my gosh, that’s a long poop

Blake: Hahahaha *hits table*... yeah, I’m a professional, 
		It’s like *does snaps in z formation*
		If it’s about the money?? You know Ima fuckin pull 
Out,, or uhh, poop out.

…I like to pee on people for money

Scotty: Wait so what did you do with the poop after?

Blake: Oh he just stayed there for a couple minutes enjoying it… I just pooped and then 
I went to the bathroom

Scotty: Sometimes I enjoy poop in the sense that I am pooping and it feels good to poop… I
like pooping from my perspective

Blake: HAhahaha, you like pooping as a human being?

Scotty: Yeah, it’s great

Blake: I think we all do

Scotty: I poop so much when I’m at work

Blake: Yeah?

Scotty: Yeah

Blake: I love that.. I love that for you…
		No, when I work, I guess I been doing this for like
 		2.5 years

Scotty: Do you know any taekwondo? Or like self-defense in 
case anything crazy happens?

Blake: ….no, I really want to (solemn turn in conversation)
	I really want to because crazy stuff Has happened

Scotty: I bet

Blake: And I wish .. yeah… so like, thank you for bringing that up, thank you for reminding me,
 because, *sigh* I really want to…

Scotty: You should, I mean, for one, it’s good physical exercise, and it’s just good to know,
 you could learn a lot of good moves. Taekwondo is cool.

Blake: Taekwondo. I really wanna do it because like,
	Okay I know I’m an actor, I know I’m a stripper, but like “Nicolas”, my real name, the ‘other
   guy’, he’s like the vegan prep chef, the reiki master, he’s like all of that, I’ve just been
    focusing on “Blake”, but no I’m really all about… yeah… yeah

Scotty: What does it feel like to be “Blake” vs “Nicolas”

Blake: They’re really completely guys… Can I tell you a secret?

Scotty: Yeah

Blake: Well it’s not a secret, but can I tell you how “Blake” became?  Okay, I was meditating, 
like years ago cuz I was really serious, I’m like okay, if I’m gonna do it I’m gonna do it. So 
I meditated on “Blake” and I asked myself, like, which one of my favorite artists all have sex 
and have a baby?? And that would be me?? So it turned out to be Megan the Stallion, Ke$ha, Bad 
Bunny, Bella Hadid Cunt..

Scotty: So because they all had babies you thought you needed to have a baby too?

Blake: No, they ALL had sex and they just had one baby.. Yeah.. thats, “Blake” ahahaha , and a 
sprinkle of Lana Del Ray

Scotty: So that’s what “Blake” is? It’s a combination of all those celebrities?

Blake: Huh?

Scotty: You’re saying “Blake” is a combination of all those celebrities who are you idols?

Blake: Yes, yeah

Scotty: So how does that relate to having a baby?

Blake: TttThat’s the crazy part, it’s like, I just picture them all having sex..

Scotty: OH so you’re the baby?

Blake: ..having sex and just making ONE baby, I’m that baby..
	Yeah…

Scotty: That’s really cool

Blake: Also I’m the cast of Schitt's Creek, hahah

Scotty: I’ve never seen that, but I’ve heard of it

Blake: They are also a part of.. My art.

Scotty: What kind of art do you do besides acting? Or is it just your way of life?

Blake: I trust you.. I like you.. I’m gonna tell you, I’m gonna start this company that’s c
alled *REDACTED* where it’s like a mixture of *REDACTED* and *REDACTED* and *REDACTED* and 
just reminding people to *REDACTED*, and that’s *REDACTED*

Scotty: That’s cool, are you excited to start a company?

Blake: Yeah

Scotty: I would too if I was you. That’s pretty unimaginable to me, to start a company

Blake: What are your thoughts on it? Be honest

Scotty: I don’t fully understand what it is, like I don’t even know what *REDACTED* is 
or *REDACTED* or *REDACTED*
	Like what makes this a crazy idea?
	Tell me why this is, *Scotty makes actions with his hands that implies an idea so great 
  that it makes your brain explode*... That

Blake: Because baby, when I’m teaching my student, and teaching my people who come to my 
classes, were just learning how to like … because… the normal thing when you’re doing
 *REDACTED* or whatever or with a *REDACTED* practitioner, it’s just that they just 
 grab energy from the universe and just spread it on you,
	I’m just like different, I wanna like see people laughing., dancing, being silly, 
  connecting with your inner child, um going all out, and just being sexy as well, umm yeah.

Scotty: So you’re silly and sexy

Blake: Yeah HAhahahaHa

Scotty: Are those your two favorite things to be? I think that is you.. You're silly 
and sexy. It’s like your two top things

Blake: Really?

Scotty: Maybe.. You’re silly, sexy, and smiley, 

Blake: And nasty

Scotty: you’re crazy

Blake: HAhaHAHA, wait till you see me work

Scotty: Maybe I’ll come one day for fun

Blake: Yeah being your girlfriends

Scotty: I don’t have that many girlfriends

Blake: It’s so funny, so I work last night.. Wait , what’s today? Today’s thursday.
 So I worked last night, bitch, I was number one, it was a slow night, I was number one, like 

Scotty: Do you have sex with your co-workers?

Blake: No, cause they’re all pretty much straight.

Scotty: I work with mostly gay guys actually

Blake: In your corporate job??

Scotty: No I work at a restaurant

Blake: Where?

Scotty: In Williamsburg

Blake: Oh yeah… That makes sense now. Do they hit on you?

Scotty: They are fun. Uh there is one guy who says he’s in love with me and I call him papi. I like it

Blake: You’re cute

Scotty: Thanks

Blake: I would sit on your face.. For some money..HAAHhaha

Scotty: You’d have to pay me for that

Blake: Oh No no no no no, oh yeah, this is why I wanted to say… speaking of that, yesterday, yeah, 
I was number one and there was a point where like, I brought two customers back with me, one of
 them was a midget and the other one was just like watching, but they all fuckin paid me

Scotty: Did you suck their dick or something?

Blake: I shouldn’t but I did 

Scotty: Hahaha

Blake: I did… I have to be careful, but I was careful, I was like keep it down.

Scotty: What are the chances that the midget is a secret cop? There can’t be many undercover midget cops

Blake: The real reason is because that place I work, on Wednesdays, we work at 2 different places, 
one near *REDACTED* and the other near *REDACTED*, but no, it’s like, I’m just always careful with
 my bosses because there is also a thing like, a shower scene, like there’s a shower, and I talked 
 to the owner of that bar uhhh I guess I’m doing it next Wednesday… uhh yeah when it comes to my 
 bosses I’m really so respectful

Scotty: Wait so there’s a shower scene and that’s like a special event and you got chosen for it? 
Congratulations 

Blake: Yeah I told my boss, I’m like, I wanna do it. And he’s like, okay, look at this guy and 
how he does it. And I told my boss I can do it way sexier. And he was like okay, and yeah *snap*...
	Are you gonna get me a beer?

Scotty: Get you a beer? I’ll contribute 3 dollars towards a beer

Blake: No, get me a beer. 

Scotty: Why? I’m not gonna have sex with you

Blake: No I’m just really having fun making a new friend

Scotty: You just told me you made so much money

Blake: I know I spent it all

Scotty: Go get yourself a beer. Here’s some money, you can get a budweiser.

Blake: Thanks babe I’ll be right back, watch this okay?

<p>April 24, 2025

    …I am 23 right now. I don’t know if I’m where I imagined I’d be at 23. Though I guess 
    I never even plotted out where I would be before. Maybe if I would’ve I could’ve ended 
    up there and I woulda been really successful or feel like I am doing really good at life. 
        Currently I’m doing okay at life. I think when I was 18 or 19 I felt so much momentum
        in my life. It felt like everything was just getting better and I was improving at all
         my skills and doing good at making people pay attention to the music I made. I felt 
         like I was on a path to maybe be a successful artist. Successful in the sense that I
          imagined I would get signed to a record label and tour and everyone would recognize
           my talents and it would be awesome and I would be best friends with all the artists 
           I ever looked up to.
        That didn’t happen,,
    Yet…
           I don’t know what will happen or what I even want to happen as I get older. I guess
            I want to keep getting better at stuff. I do think I’ve gotten a lot better at
             most the stuff I do. I’ve gotten worse at some things too. But mostly better at stuff. 
        In some ways I’m a lot more confident than I used to be and in some ways I’m not. 
        I think when I was 18 I was blindly confident. It was a small time in my life where 
        I didn’t seem to worry about being cringe. I think it probably resulted in some cringe
         art or actions, but also it was probably the most creatively liberated time of my life so far. 
        I guess I’m just hoping things will get better when I get older this time. I think in
         the past couple years I hit the happiness peak of life so far and I’ve definitely felt
          the downhill slope after finishing college and moving to New York. 
        When I was 18 and moved to Boston from Houston for school it was maybe the best year of my
         life. Either maybe that year or the one right after. I felt the most free and happy I 
         ever have. At least since I was like 5 maybe. 
        When I was 5 I remember feeling generally happy and when I started to turn 7 I started to 
        become more aware of the world and the world was harder than it was before and I felt 
        sad more, or ashamed more, or embarrassed more; just more negative feelings generally.
        I wonder where I’ll be in 5 years. I’ll probably get more mature. I think I’m still immature.
         Somewhat, I’m working on it, but I hope I stay playful.
        I hope I’m proud of the things I make and it would be cool if I was successful so 
        I don’t still work at the restaurant.
        Working at the restaurant is okay.
        I like my co-workers, they are funny and I prank them and we tickle each other and 
        most of them are gay and they speak spanish and I try to listen and learn.
        But also it kinda sucks working there. It’s generally pretty boring. I have so much 
        more fun being at home working on whatever I want like music or collaging or 
        making this website or anything. 
        It’s a lot more fun being at home than being at work.
        I think everyone feels that way.
        I just hope I can find a way to break the system so I can do whatever I want and be Lazy and HAVE FUN.
